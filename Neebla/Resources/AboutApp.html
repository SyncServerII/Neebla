        <h1>Neebla: An experiment in self-owned social media.</h1>
        
        <h2>Your Data in Your Cloud</h2>
        When you are the original person to upload a media item using Neebla (e.g., an image or a URL), that media item gets stored as files in <em>your</em> cloud storage.
        For example, if you sign in with Google Drive, and then upload a new image, that image and its associated comment file gets stored in your Google Drive.
        If you add a comment to another persons originally uploaded media item, that gets added to the <em>other person's</em> comment file.
        
        <h3>Social Users</h3>
        If you invite someone who doesn't have cloud storage to share your Neebla album (e.g., an Apple or Facebook user), then any original uploads they do will get stored in <em>your</em> cloud storage.
        
        <h2>Don't Change These Files</h2>
        Since Neebla's files are stored in your cloud storage, it is within your power to change those files. E.g., to remove them, to change their names, or change their contents.
        <em>But: Don't do this.</em>
        If you do change these files, this may make it impossible for Neebla to access or otherwise use the files. And it might crash the app or cause other unwanted behavior.
        HOWEVER, if you want to stop using Neebla these files are, of course, yours to do with what you want.
        
        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        Special thanks to my brothers by other fathers and mothers, Dany Ligas and Bushrod Thomas. Their ideas and testing efforts in no small part have made Neebla what it is!
