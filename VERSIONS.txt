Neebla

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build)
	* Added iOSSignIn calls to try to fix credentials refresh issue, when server is restarted. Now, credentials will refresh when (a) app comes into foreground, and (b) when app starts.
	* Add progress spinner on URL picker. URL picker searches for no more than 10 seconds. And tapping multiple times while doing URL search does nothing.
		
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210331.0)
	* Update to iOSBasics to fix https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/9
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210329.1)
	* Trying to fix debug logs sent to developer

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210329.0)
	* Extended usage of UserDisplayable protocol
	* Added current upload debugging to logs sent to developer.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210328.2)
	* Second attempt to fix Rod's issue-- with update to iOSBasics.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210328.1)
	* Fix to iOSBasics issue: Should deal with issue Rod reported: attemptToQueueUploadOfVNAndV0Files.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210328.0)
	* iOSBasics change: Deal with "v0 contents for change resolver (CommentFile) were not valid"
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210327.0)
	* Added scroll view to settings to improve layout.
		And improved layout of Settings screen otherwise too.
	* Improved About text in Settings.
	* Fixed: Tapping on left menu button when sharing albums: Now resets album sharing icons.
	* Trying to fix network detection issue when app comes into the foreground.
	* Fix sort order issue on album items screen. Changing the sort order using the album title control from album items screen didn't immediately make the change.
	* Refactored badging code-- to try to make it easier to diagnose issues. For example, I'm seeing some issues with the download indicators showing there is content downloadable for an album, but no apparent new content showing up when I download. Plus, on at least one occasion I got a push notification about a new comment but couldn't see it when I downloaded content for that album.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210321.0)
	* Dealing with broken sharing extension: Wasn't detecting foreground/background state of of sharing extension.
	* Fixed: Download indicator issues, from Dany. The download indicators are acting up. Albums that are caught up are still showing the download indicators. That's new.
	* Fixed: When I click share albums, but don't pick an album, I can still click add album (from Dany).

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210320.2)
	* Doing “Mark all read” done in a bg thread. Previously, it took a long time. And locked up the UI.
	* Calling into new iOSBasics for change of app state (the method turns off timer in iOSBasics if app is in background).
	* In album items screen, sharing state was not reset by Sync/Mark all read. Select “Share Items” in hamburger menu in album items screen. Tap on either Sync or Mark all read. The sharing state now gets reset.
	* Sometimes pull to refresh didn't terminate. It just sat there. Put bounds on how long the spinners will appear.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210320.1)
	* Added another check for app in foreground with badge updating. And changed value of AppState to background-- as it seems like a safer default.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210320.0)
	* Still working on trying to fix crashes. Not sending some notifications when the app is in the background.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210319.3)
	* Move to using a single SQLite db. See https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/7#issuecomment-803251069
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210319.2)
	* Still trying to fix crashes. This time added BackgroundAsssertable calls in `objectWasDownloaded` and in observer for `ServerFileModel.unreadCountUpdate` -- which calls `updateBadge`.
	* Wasn't getting Firebase/Crashlytics reports-- changed configuration to use Neebla app.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210319.1)
	* Based on crash reports from Apple (see https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/7#issuecomment-802978539), I've added further BackgroundAsssertable calls in iOS Basics.
	* Removed some unuseful error logging.
	* Replaced Bugsnag with Firebase/Crashlytics.
		
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210319.0)
	* Working on crash issue. Added use of `BackgroundAsssertable` from iOSBasics.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210317.0)
	* Trying to resolve crash issue. Now not starting network requests when app is in background, and when network not reachable.
	* Working on not updating UI when app in background.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210314.1)
	* Fixed issue with unread counts for albums-- make sure they aren't counting deleted objects.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210314.0)
	* Fixed: Consistent server errors in dealers choice album.
		Seems to be: attemptToQueueADeletedFile; happening when attempting to queue downloads. This is the file: iOSBasics.DownloadFile(uuid: 25D6D1DF-5F4B-4F56-A816-6B841EA63F38, fileVersion: 4, fileLabel: "comments"). This was a problem with files being indicated as downloadable from iOSBasics, which had already been deleted.
	* Fix GIF error where sometimes a GIF seems like it uploads, but there's no actual GIF. And I've had problems deleting these too. The problem turns out that Chrome saves a "GIF" as a single slice. I've now put in code and UI messaging disallowing this.
	* Added Info in Settings explaining some basic facts: 1) Every image you upload goes into your Drive/Dropbox. 2) Others adding comments to what you uploaded originally goes into yours.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210313.2)
	* Added check box to enable/disable GIF playback.
	* Fix issue with tapping on URL media link and coming back showing you comments.

	* Added use of Bugsnag-- crash reporting.
	* Trying to fix background crash issue with change to SQLite

	* Added support for GIF media type!
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210311.0)
	* Changed file protection attributes of database-- to enable access in background.
		Trying to see if this is what was causing crashes.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210310.0)
	* I have one item, in the Cats album, that won't download.
		There is no DownloadFileTracker. I'm not sure why it's not counted as something needing download. There *is* a DownloadObjectTracker. It seems like that ought to have been removed. Not sure why. Due to some crash? Going to put in some recovery code. Made change to fix in iOSBasics.
	* Fix Facebook sign in issues.
	* Download indicator-- Is on in some cases, but doesn't actually indicate downloads available. I.e., going to the album and refreshing doesn't clear it. This suggests that the album refresh isn't resetting the download indicator.
		Made a change that attempts to fix this.
	* Crash when put app in the background and its downloading.
		- Fixed one issue in Neebla and one issue in iOSFacebook package

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210309.0)
	* Fix download indicators:
		I wasn't relying on the row model flag-- fixed that.
	* Fix push notifications: Wasn't getting 'em.
	* Fix album screen reload-- having to tap on reload to get initial load.
		Fixed both of these-- same root cause.
