Neebla

Version 2.0.7 (TestFlight Builds: 20210712.0)
	* Added more detailed UI error messages back in, but only for dev builds.
	* Add support for move file groups in the UI
		- Generalized album list UI used in deletion
			So I can use it in file group move destination selection.
		- Sending a push notification to the people in the source album and 
			in the destination album.
	* Fixed issue with "Share items" menu icon-- it wasn't colored as disabled
		when it was actually disabled.
	* Some refactoring to clean up `Screen` view.
	* Fix an "flicker" issue with items when they are downloading on the album items
		screen. Previously, if *any* attributes for a ServerObjectModel had changed
		this refetched/replace all object models and the reload appears to have
		been the cause of the flicker. Have changed now to just a more specific
		identity change.
	* Fixed an issue where download indicators would get not get reset properly
		when a user had been removed from an album.

Version 2.0.6 (TestFlight Builds: 20210626.0, 20210627.0, 20210629.0, 20210701.0,
								20210701.1, 20210702.0)
	* Update to iOSBasics to fix user sign out issue.
		And removed unused delegate method that was removed from iOSBasics.
	* Changed away from using .navigationBarTitle as it's deprecated in SwiftUI
		And trying to fix issue where nav bar disappears.
	* Fixed iPad issue: When I showed badge menu, I could no longer then show comments
		by tapping on the image. (Does not repro on iPhone)
	* Users can now see the badges of others
		- Changes to badges are now uploaded with `FileUpload.informNoOne` -- so others
	 	are alerted to these changes. QA (Rod and Dany) didn't seem to want to be informed
	 	of these changes.
		- Limit of four badges of others in large media item view.
		- Limit of two badges of others in icon media item view on iPad.
		- Have "Others" as title of badges of others, with gray outline.
	* App now collects email addresses of users and stores in server db.
		This happens in check creds request (for migration), and in add user and
		redeem sharing invitations that add new users.
		See https://github.com/SyncServerII/ServerMain/issues/16
	* Fixed aspect ratio constraint issue -- to be just a constraint on minimum 
		height or width of an image.
	* Added ability to add/delete keywords to/from media items.
		Including a "K" icon on details screen when there are keyword(s).
	* Using updated SideMenu package to hopefully fix issue with nav bar disappearing.
		See https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/22
		Had to update background color on albums screen too-- as the Fix to SideMenu
		had an odd background color interaction.		

Version 2.0.5 (TestFlight Build 20210621.1)
	* Using update to iOSBasics for adding parameter to GetUploadResults
		And some improved logging.
	
Version 2.0.5 (TestFlight Build 20210621.0)
	* Using fix to iOSBasics for restart of downloading a media item
		- And improved logging for credentials refresh.
	* Improved UI/alert messaging for restart of downloading
	* Updated to new `iOSGoogle` package version for improved logging.

Version 2.0.5 (TestFlight Build 20210620.1)
	* A long press on a small icon now enables restart of downloading if the media item has
		downloading files.
	* Added a temporary fix for uploads-- to restart uploads if the deferredUploadId can't
		 be found.
	
Version 2.0.5 (TestFlight Build 20210620.0)
	* Another fix to debugging information to try to diagnose a file not downloading issue.

Version 2.0.5 (TestFlight Build 20210619.0)
	* Refactor to pull out common media item attributes code to a single file.
	* Similar refactor for common comment file code.
	* If a user enters the media items screen now and there is no underlying media item
		attributes file, one will be created and uploaded.
		- This will enable favorites to be added on demand for older media items.
		- And will enable tracking of read counts for older media items.
		- It also brings in the first instance of a possible UUID collision. If two people
			try to add a media items attributes file for the same media item, they can
			collide. The loser of the race will receive a UUID collision result. And is coded
			to update to the winning UUID.
			This is tricky to test.
	* Fix issue with unread count badge on large media item screen
		- It was not consistently getting reset when you'd read comments.
	* Add another badge type: Hide
		- This has some additional functionality: When you select Hide, it hides the image
		so you can't see it, instead showing you an indicative graphic. You can later
		unhide it.
		- The image becomes hidden both in the icons and large images, until you unhide it.
	* Stopped calling `Downloader.session.objectAccessed` from the large item screen.
		- Not sure why that was there. Seems unneeded since it should have been called
		from the icon screen already-- as the object was viewed and hence "accessed" there.
	* Cleaned up where the media item badges are displayed. Now displayed in the 
		AnyIcon and AnyLargeMedia-- which is where other badging is located.
	* Improved UpperRightView and modifier using ViewBuilder.
	* Added debugging information to try to diagnose a file not downloading issue.
	
Version 2.0.4 (TestFlight Build 20210617.0); This is the actual app store release of v2.0.4
	* When a badge (favorite) is changed, don't inform anyone. Previously we had
		been informing others, but badges for self don't show up the UI for others yet.
	
Version 2.0.4 (TestFlight Build 20210616.0)
	* Extended Media Item Attributes to include selecting/deselecting a favorite.
		- A favorite for one media item is available for download on another device.
		- Favorites are edited on the media item details screen.
			Using a new pull down menu with the possible badges.
		- And shown on the media item details screen and the album items screen.
		- So far you cannot view other people's favorites.
	* MIGRATION: Added a badge field to ServerFileModel for media item attribute files only.
	* Like the unread counts, the favorites only apply to newly created media items.
		- Though, they apply to files uploaded since the read count change too.
	* Added a fix for https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/17
		- No longer doing basic credentials refresh on app launch.
		- Update to iOSBasics which now does credentials refresh for basic network requests.

Version 2.0.3 (TestFlight Build 20210614.0); This is the actual app store release of v2.0.3
	* Media Item Attributes-- a new file per media item.
		- So far, working on this to add cross-device read counts for media items, stored
			per user. Refactored read count code to make it easier to manage and read.
		- So far adding only to newly created media items; 
			not yet adding to previously created items.
		- Have added this to the image, GIF, URL, and live images object types.

Version 2.0.2 (TestFlight Build 20210605.0); This is the actual app store release of v2.0.2
	* Working on download indicators
		MIGRATION: Added `lastSyncDate` field to album models.
			This was needed because:
			(a) when you are newly invited to an album, it wasn't showing up as
				needing download.
			(b) if you didn't use the app for a period of days, 
				the `informAllButSelf` values would expire and the albums wouldn't
				necessarily show you need to do a download.
		- Improved updating, based on 
			https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/15#issuecomment-852567995
	* Separating out more code for download indicators
		Making the download indicator code more modular, separated from other code.
	* Simplified AlbumsScreenRow SwiftUI View to fix an update issue
		Sometimes a change to a download indicator would not persist across scrolling.
	* Fixed an issue where with no inform records from server, download indicator would not
		get updated.
	* Fixed an issue where mostRecentDate for *all* albums could get updated on a sync
		for a specific album. Now, mostRecentDate is only updated for a single album on
		sync for a specific album.

Version 2.0.1 (TestFlight Build 20210531.0); This is the actual app store release of v2.0.1
	* Change some of the logging when sending an email to developer to `notice` from `error`
		These still hit the logs. (They were not errors in the first place.)
	* Change a couple of other log messages from `error` to `warning` so they don't hit the
		production logs. They were not serious issues.
	* Fix Rod's issue: Live image audio plays again when you enter discussions 
		and when you exit the item.
	* Update for self vs. other updates. Improvements to the download indicators to better
		indicate to the current user whether changes were made by self or others.
		- Does not require server update to v1.10.2, because I'm going to initially release this
			app version using v1.9.0 of the server. Then once approved and available on the app store
			I'll update the server.
		- Changes to all current file uploads to indicate `informAllButSelf` is true.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210523.0); This is the actual app store release of v2.0.0
	* Use latest `iOSApple` library-- improve Apple Sign In button to better conform
		to Apple's guidelines (due to Apple rejection).
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210522.0)
	* Have taken out "There was a server error." generic errors.

		And make use of iOSBasics update for the same issue.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210515.0)
	* Use updated `iOSBasics` -- fix sharing group user deletion issue.
		See https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/12
		No longer considering an album deleted just if we don't get a report about it from the server.
	* Use updated `iOSShared` -- improving db migration support.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210509.0)
	* Use updated `iOSBasics` -- fixing server down "bad version" issue.
		And db migration support.

	* Added Acks for images
	* Update to iOSBasics 0.22.0: Version checking, failover, and bug fix.
	* Update to iOSShared 0.11.1: Enabling alert messages to be queued and displayed one after another.

	* Fixed issue with images not uploading with URL.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210404.2)

	* Add progress spinner on URL picker. URL picker searches for no more than 10 seconds. And tapping multiple times while doing URL search does nothing.
		
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210331.0)
	* Update to iOSBasics to fix https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/9
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210329.1)
	* Trying to fix debug logs sent to developer

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210329.0)
	* Extended usage of UserDisplayable protocol
	* Added current upload debugging to logs sent to developer.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210328.2)

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210327.0)
	* Added scroll view to settings to improve layout.
		And improved layout of Settings screen otherwise too.
	* Improved About text in Settings.
	* Fixed: Tapping on left menu button when sharing albums: Now resets album sharing icons.
	* Trying to fix network detection issue when app comes into the foreground.
	* Fix sort order issue on album items screen. Changing the sort order using the album title control from album items screen didn't immediately make the change.
	* Refactored badging code-- to try to make it easier to diagnose issues. For example, I'm seeing some issues with the download indicators showing there is content downloadable for an album, but no apparent new content showing up when I download. Plus, on at least one occasion I got a push notification about a new comment but couldn't see it when I downloaded content for that album.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210321.0)
	* Dealing with broken sharing extension: Wasn't detecting foreground/background state of of sharing extension.
	* Fixed: Download indicator issues, from Dany. The download indicators are acting up. Albums that are caught up are still showing the download indicators. That's new.
	* Fixed: When I click share albums, but don't pick an album, I can still click add album (from Dany).

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210320.2)
	* Doing “Mark all read” done in a bg thread. Previously, it took a long time. And locked up the UI.
	* Calling into new iOSBasics for change of app state (the method turns off timer in iOSBasics if app is in background).
	* In album items screen, sharing state was not reset by Sync/Mark all read. Select “Share Items” in hamburger menu in album items screen. Tap on either Sync or Mark all read. The sharing state now gets reset.
	* Sometimes pull to refresh didn't terminate. It just sat there. Put bounds on how long the spinners will appear.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210320.1)
	* Added another check for app in foreground with badge updating. And changed value of AppState to background-- as it seems like a safer default.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210320.0)
	* Still working on trying to fix crashes. Not sending some notifications when the app is in the background.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210319.3)
	* Move to using a single SQLite db. See https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/7#issuecomment-803251069
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210319.2)
	* Still trying to fix crashes. This time added BackgroundAsssertable calls in `objectWasDownloaded` and in observer for `ServerFileModel.unreadCountUpdate` -- which calls `updateBadge`.
	* Wasn't getting Firebase/Crashlytics reports-- changed configuration to use Neebla app.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210319.1)
	* Based on crash reports from Apple (see https://github.com/SyncServerII/Neebla/issues/7#issuecomment-802978539), I've added further BackgroundAsssertable calls in iOS Basics.
	* Removed some unuseful error logging.
	* Replaced Bugsnag with Firebase/Crashlytics.
		
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210319.0)
	* Working on crash issue. Added use of `BackgroundAsssertable` from iOSBasics.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210317.0)
	* Trying to resolve crash issue. Now not starting network requests when app is in background, and when network not reachable.
	* Working on not updating UI when app in background.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210314.1)
	* Fixed issue with unread counts for albums-- make sure they aren't counting deleted objects.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210314.0)
	* Fixed: Consistent server errors in dealers choice album.
		Seems to be: attemptToQueueADeletedFile; happening when attempting to queue downloads. This is the file: iOSBasics.DownloadFile(uuid: 25D6D1DF-5F4B-4F56-A816-6B841EA63F38, fileVersion: 4, fileLabel: "comments"). This was a problem with files being indicated as downloadable from iOSBasics, which had already been deleted.
	* Fix GIF error where sometimes a GIF seems like it uploads, but there's no actual GIF. And I've had problems deleting these too. The problem turns out that Chrome saves a "GIF" as a single slice. I've now put in code and UI messaging disallowing this.
	* Added Info in Settings explaining some basic facts: 1) Every image you upload goes into your Drive/Dropbox. 2) Others adding comments to what you uploaded originally goes into yours.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210313.2)
	* Added check box to enable/disable GIF playback.
	* Fix issue with tapping on URL media link and coming back showing you comments.

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210311.0)
	* Changed file protection attributes of database-- to enable access in background.
		Trying to see if this is what was causing crashes.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210310.0)
	* I have one item, in the Cats album, that won't download.
		There is no DownloadFileTracker. I'm not sure why it's not counted as something needing download. There *is* a DownloadObjectTracker. It seems like that ought to have been removed. Not sure why. Due to some crash? Going to put in some recovery code. Made change to fix in iOSBasics.
	* Fix Facebook sign in issues.
	* Download indicator-- Is on in some cases, but doesn't actually indicate downloads available. I.e., going to the album and refreshing doesn't clear it. This suggests that the album refresh isn't resetting the download indicator.
		Made a change that attempts to fix this.
	* Crash when put app in the background and its downloading.
		- Fixed one issue in Neebla and one issue in iOSFacebook package

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210309.0)
	* Fix download indicators:
		I wasn't relying on the row model flag-- fixed that.
	* Fix push notifications: Wasn't getting 'em.
	* Fix album screen reload-- having to tap on reload to get initial load.
		Fixed both of these-- same root cause.

		https://github.com/SyncServerII/iOSBasics/issues/2
	* Adding username support in Settings due to comments issue.
	* Added name field to SQLite SettingsModel
	* Enabled file logs to be sent to the developer.
	* Now hiding keyboard on successful user name change.
		And other UX improvements for user name change.
	* Improved error logging reporting via iOSBasics package.
	* Attempt to fix push notification with app in foreground issue.
	* Improve badge counts on albums screen and album items screen.
	* Updates to iOSGoogle to fix key chain storage issue.

	* Added dark mode support.
	* Live images now starting to play when you go to details screen.
	* Fix issue: Show error messages on sharing screen.
	* Adding aspect ratio constraint for images.

	* Improve the serverHasUpdate method-- using a max local file version.
	* iOSBasics improvements to retry uploading.
	* Fix issue with sharing extension not populating album list initially.
	* Fix issue with Apple Sign In-- e.g., restarting app no longer signs user out.

Version 2.0.0 (1/29/21)
	* First successful upload of this version to iTunes Connect. 
	* Server is on my iMac (a little flaky). 
	* Push Notifications are not yet working.
