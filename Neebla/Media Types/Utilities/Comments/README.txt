Comment files (discussions) have three roles:

1) To store discussions (of course!)
2) To store meta data that could possibly be used to reconstruct objects from their constituent files if the user only had their cloud storage data (and didn't have SyncServer or Neebla).
3) To store media titles

The reason for the second two roles is because *every* media type has a comment file so this is a place where we can store this common or shared information.
