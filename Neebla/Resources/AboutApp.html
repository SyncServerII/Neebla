        <h1>Your Data in Your Cloud</h1>
        When you are the original person to upload a media item (e.g., an image or a URL), that gets stored as files in <em>your</em> cloud storage.
        For example, if you sign in with Google Drive, and then upload a new image, that image and its associated comment file gets stored in your Google Drive.
        If you add a comment to another persons originally uploaded media item, that gets added to the <em>other person's</em> comment file.
        
        <h2>Social Users</h2>
        If you invite someone who doesn't have cloud storage to share your album (e.g., an Apple or Facebook user), then any original uploads they do will get stored in <em>your</em> cloud storage.
