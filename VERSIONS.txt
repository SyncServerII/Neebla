Neebla

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210313.0)
	* Added in scrolling/panning with large images.
	* Added support for GIF media type!
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210311.0)
	* Changed file protection attributes of database-- to enable access in background.
		Trying to see if this is what was causing crashes.
	
Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210310.0)
	* I have one item, in the Cats album, that won't download.
		There is no DownloadFileTracker. I'm not sure why it's not counted as something needing download. There *is* a DownloadObjectTracker. It seems like that ought to have been removed. Not sure why. Due to some crash? Going to put in some recovery code. Made change to fix in iOSBasics.
	* Fix Facebook sign in issues.
	* Download indicator-- Is on in some cases, but doesn't actually indicate downloads available. I.e., going to the album and refreshing doesn't clear it. This suggests that the album refresh isn't resetting the download indicator.
		Made a change that attempts to fix this.
	* Crash when put app in the background and its downloading.
		- Fixed one issue in Neebla and one issue in iOSFacebook package

Version 2.0.0 (TestFlight Build 20210309.0)
	* Fix download indicators:
		I wasn't relying on the row model flag-- fixed that.
	* Fix push notifications: Wasn't getting 'em.
	* Fix album screen reload-- having to tap on reload to get initial load.
		Fixed both of these-- same root cause.
